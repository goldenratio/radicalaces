# Radical Aces Classic

Original game: http://www.radicalplay.com/radicalaces/

I fetched game resources from web archives and ported game over to run on Swing frame instead of browser frame, as Java plugin is disabled on browsers nowadays

## Playing

Check [Releases](https://github.com/mikroskeem/radicalaces/releases), download the jar, run it to play (double click or whatever way
you use to launch apps).

Invoke `./gradlew` and grab `build/libs/radicalaces.jar`. If you don't know what any of this means, then don't bother.
